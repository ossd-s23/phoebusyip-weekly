title: "Week 15: Presenting"
---

This week we finally presented to the whole class, and also looked at what others have done this semester. It was really inspiring to see what others did over the past few weeks, especially for those who ventured out into working in unfamiliar environments (e.g. the p5.js team). I actually took a class that used p5.js a few years back, and thought of that tool as a great way for beginners to learn how to visually code. The syntax is simple, yet it still has a slight learning curve, so hearing about that particular team's effort into learning p5.js felt nostalgic. 

As for my team, I think we did our presentation pretty well. What I noticed about our team versus other teams is that we focused more on coding contributions, such as adding and enhancing new features to Jarvis, while other teams had more variety and worked on aspects such as translations and documentation. I think it came down to their maintainers / project having less creative space for maintainers to contribute to. Looking back, Jarvis was a really fun project because it is essentially a tool tied together by many Python functions, so we really got to be creative with the functions and APIs we wanted to add. 

Lastly, it was funny to hear about other teams' struggle with being "sniped" with issues - it's always reassuring to have other people face, and solve, the same issues you once dide.
