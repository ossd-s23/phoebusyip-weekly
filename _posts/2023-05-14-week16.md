title: "Week 16: Final Week"
---

This week is the last week of the semester. It was interesting to do the final reflection asynchronously, because it gave me time to be alone and reflect upon the semester. I enjoyed recalling about other people's project, and writing about it in my reflection. I remember being particularly impressed by group 4's work on MindsDB, just because the tech stack seemed difficult and because machine learning was a big part of the project. Writing about the question regarding what a future student should/shouldn't do took much longer than I had expected, because it felt like I had to reflect and think about how my journey has been from week 1 until now. In the end, I picked consistency as the one thing future students should do, and I realized that this trait is something that would help in most classes, especially CS ones that require students to self-learn. 

Overall, I think I definitely learnt a lot from this class, especially on how to work with team members and random strangers on the internet. I would recommend this class to most people who are interested in learning and coding with others on projects that actually feel meaningful (as opposed to boring homework assignments that are assigned).
