title: "Week 5: Thoughts on this week's guest lecture"
---

Mek's guest lecture was really interesting and I’m glad we got to listen to his expertise and knowledge in the open-source world. The most memorable part of the guest lecture is that digital library acts similarly to a physical library – borrowing one book off the digital library makes the book become “off-shelf”, in digital terms. This way, problems and consequences with copyright are handled. I think that this is a wonderful way to approach this issue, although it might be hard for dismissive skeptics to understand, or believe that. Perhaps one way to further promote digital libraries is to emphasize this part of digital libraries. Watching Mek’s enthusiastic take on the project as he explained how he had to fill big shoes when working on the project was inspiring, and I hope to have the same enthusiasm for projects that I involve myself with in the future. Mek also seemed extremely welcoming, and I could feel his enthusiasm reaching me and many other students. I still want to look at other open-source projects before deciding on one, so I’m going to continue looking at other options.

As for my contributions, I’ve made contributions to an open source project called MonitorControl, which is a software I have been using myself for a while now. It’s a very helpful software that lets me control external monitors and their brightness, which for some reason is locked by default for some monitors on MacOS (you need to control brightness through the monitor’s hardware buttons). My contribution was a simple one that was a fix, inspired by another contributor’s comment, but I hope I helped troubleshoot that person’s issue. I have also made Wikipedia edits and OpenStreetMap contributions in people and locations that I am interested in. I agree that at the end of the day, passion and interest in what you are contributing to matters most.
