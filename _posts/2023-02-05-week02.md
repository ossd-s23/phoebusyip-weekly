The Code of Conduct exercise was interesting because we got to see how projects regulate and suggest behaviors that other contributors should follow. For the Go priject, I think the main benefit of having this document is that when there are offenders (e.g a contributor who is verbally aggressive to others), there are clear means to deal with that situation. By writing out the standards and things that are not accepted, it is easier to justify punishment or some sort of resolution. I think other projects, especially ones with moderation, could greatly benefit from this. I especially like how the Go developers mention that it is reasonable for people to disagree with each other, as long as they disagree and communicate in a respectful manner. 

The activity we did in class involving the add-on activity was interesting. I've had some experience in following tutorials to learn a new tech stack, so the tutorial part wasn't too difficult even though I've never worked with Firefox before. What surprised me was how well documented the tutorial and Firefox code was, instead of just telling us to copy and paste some code and giving us a general overview of what the code does, the tutorial goes in depth with what each line does, which I really appreciated as I have not coded in Javascript in a while. Learning about how licenses work and how behaviors and contributions are kept by rules was interesting, and I was surprised to see how few contributors (and how little code some contributed!) there were for the open source project we picked - Ublock Origin. It reminded me that concise code goes a long way.
