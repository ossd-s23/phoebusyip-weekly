title: Week 2

The activity we did in class involving the add-on activity was interesting. I've had some experience in following tutorials to learn a new tech stack, so the tutorial part wasn't too difficult even though I've never worked with Firefox before. What surprised me was how well documented the tutorial and Firefox code was, instead of just telling us to copy and paste some code and giving us a general overview of what the code does, the tutorial goes in depth with what each line does, which I really appreciated as I have not coded in Javascript in a while. Learning about how licenses work and how behaviors and contributions are kept by rules was interesting, and I was surprised to see how few contributors (and how little code some contributed!) there were for the open source project we picked - Ublock Origin. It reminded me that concise code goes a long way.
